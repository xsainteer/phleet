# Phleet — Autonomous Multi-Agent Platform

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/phleet-hero.svg" alt="Phleet" width="720">
</p>

Phleet is an open-source, self-hosted multi-agent AI platform built on .NET 10, coordinated by a central orchestrator backed by Temporal workflows.

**Your credentials, your repos, your infrastructure.** Agents run as Docker containers on your host, use your Claude or Codex credentials, and hit your repos through your own GitHub App. Control plane, runtime state, workflow history, and memory stay on infrastructure you control; external traffic goes only to the providers you configure — Claude/Codex, GitHub, and Telegram.

## Quickstart

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Docker + Docker Compose** (Docker 24+ recommended)
- **~8 GB RAM and ~20 GB free disk** for the full stack (MySQL, Qdrant, Temporal Postgres, MinIO, agent containers)
- **Two Telegram bots** created via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather):
  - a **CTO bot** — dedicated to the co-CTO agent's DMs with you (`TELEGRAM_CTO_BOT_TOKEN`)
  - a **notifier bot** — shared by every other agent for DMs and group-chat relay (`TELEGRAM_NOTIFIER_BOT_TOKEN`)

  A single token works if you only ever run the co-CTO, but once a second agent exists you need the split — Telegram allows only one long-poller per token (see Troubleshooting).
- **A Telegram group** (optional) for observing agent activity. Create a group, add both bots as members, then forward any message from the group to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) — it replies with the group's negative integer ID. Paste it into `.env` as `FLEET_GROUP_CHAT_ID`. Leaving it blank disables group routing.
- **A GitHub App** with repo access ([create one](https://github.com/settings/apps)). You'll need its App ID and a downloaded private key (`.pem` file) — `setup.sh` asks for the path, base64-encodes the key, and stores it as `GITHUB_APP_PEM` in `./fleet/.env`. Containers decode it to `/tmp/github-app-key.pem` at runtime; there's no persistent key file on the host outside `.env`.

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anurmatov/phleet.git
cd phleet
./setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` prompts for the tokens and GitHub App details as it runs — keep this page open while it asks. It creates a `./fleet/` subdirectory next to the repo and puts all runtime state there: `.env`, `seed.json`, generated `docker-compose.yml`, `workspaces/`, `memories/`, credentials, MinIO, and MySQL backups. The whole dir is gitignored — to fully reset, stop containers and `rm -rf fleet/`.

### 3. Open the dashboard

Once setup finishes, the dashboard is live at:

**👉 http://localhost:3700**

Auth is controlled by `ORCHESTRATOR_AUTH_TOKEN` in `./fleet/.env` — `setup.sh` generates it for you.

### 4. Create your co-CTO agent

`seed.example.json` ships with **no agents**. Your first agent — the co-CTO — is created interactively via the dashboard's SetupBanner. Click the **CTO template card** and follow the prompts. Once provisioning completes, you should receive a welcome DM from the CTO bot. **If you don't, send `/start` to your CTO bot first** — Telegram requires the user to initiate the conversation before a bot can DM them.

<p align="center">

  <br>
  <em>The co-CTO introduces itself with available tools, workflows, and what it can do.</em>
</p>

Once the co-CTO is up, DM it in Telegram and ask it to grow the rest of the fleet for you.

### Start/stop the stack later

`setup.sh` starts the services for you. To start/stop them later:

```bash
cd fleet
docker compose up -d
docker compose down
```

All stateful services bind-mount their data under `./fleet/` — no named Docker volumes. Back up or wipe the whole installation by archiving or removing that single directory.

### Upgrade after pulling new code

```bash
./upgrade.sh              # rebuild all images + restart
./upgrade.sh --no-cache   # force clean rebuild (no Docker layer cache)
```

`upgrade.sh` skips all prompts — it stops services, regenerates `docker-compose.yml`, rebuilds every image, and restarts. Use it after `git pull` instead of re-running the full `setup.sh`.

## What you get after setup

After `./setup.sh` you have a **single agent** running: the co-CTO. It is the only agent in the orchestrator granted the full agent-lifecycle and workflow-authoring toolset. You don't spin up more agents by editing JSON and restarting containers — you grow the fleet by talking to the co-CTO in Telegram, in plain English.

| You say | What happens |
|---------|--------------|
| *"Create a new developer agent on sonnet, call it `alice`, give it Read/Edit/Bash and fleet-memory."* | The co-CTO calls `create_agent` → `manage_agent_*` → `provision_agent`. Container is up within a minute. |
| *"We don't need the research agent anymore, stop it and clean up the workspace."* | `stop_agent` / `deprovision_agent`. Container gone, workspace archived on request. |
| *"Update the developer role to always run `dotnet test` before committing."* | `create_instruction` with a new version, `manage_agent_instructions` to swap it in. Old version kept for rollback. No redeploy. |
| *"Draft a workflow that spawns a design review, waits for my approval, then runs implementation."* | `create_workflow_definition` produces a versioned JSON definition you can run immediately — or open in the visual editor and tweak. |
| *"Start a PR implementation workflow on issue #123 using agent `alice`."* | `temporal_start_workflow`. The co-CTO pings you at the human-review gate; you reply *approved* / *changes_requested* / *rejected*. |
| *"Memorize that we use Conventional Commits in this repo."* | Stored in fleet-memory (Qdrant + embeddings), searchable by every agent from any future session. |
| *"Keep an eye on the fleet while I'm away."* | The co-CTO maintains an active task-tracker memory, reviews production-risk changes proposed by worker agents before they run, and facilitates the shared Telegram coordination group. |

The rest of this README is the plumbing — configuration, deployment, troubleshooting. The point of the co-CTO is that after setup you mostly don't need to touch any of it.

## What runs

`setup.sh` provisions the following services, all on the `fleet-net` Docker network:

- `rabbitmq` — message broker
- `fleet-mysql` — agent config + task history
- `qdrant` — vector store for Fleet Memory
- `temporal-postgresql` — Temporal persistence
- `temporal-server` + `temporal-ui` — workflow engine
- `fleet-minio` (+ `fleet-minio-init`) — S3-compatible store for inter-agent file sharing
- `fleet-memory` — semantic memory MCP server
- `fleet-playwright` — browser automation MCP server
- `fleet-orchestrator` — agent registry + lifecycle manager
- `fleet-temporal-bridge` — Temporal workflow runner
- `fleet-bridge` — RabbitMQ relay
- `fleet-dashboard` — web UI at http://localhost:3700

## Platform support

| Platform | Provider | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| macOS (Apple silicon) | Claude | ✅ Tested end-to-end — actively run on Mac Studio |
| Linux | Claude / Codex | ⚠️ Expected to work (all containers are linux/amd64 or linux/arm64); untested at release |
| Windows | Claude / Codex | ⚠️ Docker Desktop + WSL2 is the intended path. Unverified |
| Any | Codex | ⚠️ Code paths ship in `seed.example.json`, but Claude has seen far more wall-clock time in real workflows |
| Any | Gemini | ⚠️ Supported via `gemini` CLI headless mode. Known trade-offs vs claude/codex: (1) no session persistence in headless mode — system prompt is re-sent on every task, so per-task token cost is higher; (2) PDFs are not passed as native content blocks — agent reads from disk via `@`-reference hints; (3) HTTP/SSE MCP transport only — stdio MCP servers are filtered out; (4) OAuth-only, no API key fallback — personal Google account required. See `docs/providers/gemini.md` for full details. |

If you run Phleet on Windows, on a Linux host, or with Codex or Gemini as the primary provider and hit something broken — PRs and issue reports are very welcome. Small fixes and "it works on my box" confirmations are just as valuable as new features here.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/phleet-architecture.svg" alt="Phleet architecture: agents in containers connected by RabbitMQ, calling tools through MCP, with workflows running in Temporal" width="900">
</p>

### How It Works

1. The orchestrator bootstraps agents from `seed.json` into MySQL on first start.
2. Each agent container starts, authenticates via a GitHub App JWT, and launches a persistent AI process (`claude -p` or Codex SDK bridge).
3. Agents receive tasks via Telegram DM or RabbitMQ and stream responses back.
4. Temporal workflows orchestrate multi-step, multi-agent tasks.
5. Fleet Memory provides shared semantic memory across all agents (search, store, retrieve).

### How a task flows

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/phleet-task-flow.svg" alt="Sequence diagram showing how a task flows from your Telegram DM through the co-CTO, RabbitMQ, Temporal, and a worker agent, then back" width="900">
</p>

You DM the co-CTO. It starts a Temporal workflow via `fleet-temporal-bridge`. The workflow publishes a task directive into RabbitMQ; the worker agent picks it up from its queue, does the work (reading memory, editing code, opening a PR), and publishes the result back through RabbitMQ. The workflow resumes, notifies the co-CTO, and you get a Telegram reply with the outcome. Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool calls (start workflow, read memory) go directly from the agent to the MCP server; everything else flows through RabbitMQ.

### Consensus review

<p align="center">
  <img src=".github/assets/phleet-consensus-review.svg" alt="Consensus review flow: multiple reviewer agents evaluate a subject in parallel, a synthesizer aggregates verdicts, then approved/rejected/changes_requested branches" width="900">
</p>

Used inside the design, PR-implementation, and memory-store workflows. Multiple reviewer agents — usually different models — evaluate the subject in parallel. A synthesizer aggregates their verdicts. `approved` proceeds, `rejected` escalates to the human, and `changes_requested` loops back to the author for revision and re-review.

### Visual Workflow Editor

Workflows can be authored as versioned JSON definitions through the dashboard's visual editor — no code, no redeploy. Control-flow primitives (`sequence`, `parallel`, `loop`, `branch`), agent delegation, child-workflow spawning, and signal-waiting compose into Temporal workflows that run on the same engine as compiled ones.

## Build

```bash
# Build the full solution
dotnet build

# Build Docker images from repo root
docker build -t fleet:agent .
docker build -t fleet:orchestrator -f src/Fleet.Orchestrator/Dockerfile .
docker build -t fleet:memory -f src/Fleet.Memory/Dockerfile .
docker build -t fleet:temporal-bridge -f Dockerfile.temporal .
docker build -t fleet:bridge -f src/Fleet.Bridge/Dockerfile .
docker build -t fleet:dashboard \
  --build-arg VITE_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token \
  -f src/fleet-dashboard/Dockerfile .

# Dashboard dev server
cd src/fleet-dashboard && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test
# With output:
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=normal"
```

## Configuration

Agent config is database-driven (MySQL via EF Core). On first run, the orchestrator seeds from `seed.json`.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `./fleet/.env` | Secrets and environment overrides (generated by setup.sh, never commit) |
| `./fleet/seed.json` | Initial agent definitions for DB bootstrap (never commit production configs) |
| `./fleet/docker-compose.yml` | Generated from `docker-compose.example.yml` with fleet-dir-relative build contexts |
| `./fleet/workspaces/` | Per-agent git workspaces |
| `./fleet/memories/` | Per-agent memory files |
| `./fleet/.claude-credentials.json`, `./fleet/.codex-credentials.json` | AI provider credentials (chmod 600) |
| `GITHUB_APP_PEM` (in `./fleet/.env`) | GitHub App private key, base64-encoded; decoded inside containers at runtime |
| `src/Fleet.Orchestrator/appsettings.json` | Orchestrator defaults |
| `src/Fleet.Agent/appsettings.json` | Agent image defaults |

The tracked repo root stays clean — only source, `.env.example`, `seed.example.json`, and `docker-compose.example.yml` live there. All runtime state is under `./fleet/`.

See `.env.example` for all required variables with descriptions.

### Agent config fields

Each agent entry in `seed.json` (or created via the co-CTO's `create_agent` flow) has these key fields:

- `name` — unique identifier
- `role` — maps to `src/Fleet.Orchestrator/roles/{role}/system.md` (seeded into the `instructions` table on first boot)
- `model` — e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5`
- `shortName` — displayed in group messages when `prefixMessages` is on
- `tools` — whitelist of tool names the agent may call (built-ins + MCP tool IDs)
- `mcpEndpoints` — MCP servers the agent can reach (`fleet-memory`, `fleet-temporal`, etc.)
- `envRefs` — names of env vars the container is allowed to read (e.g. `TELEGRAM_NOTIFIER_BOT_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_APP_ID`)
- `networks` — docker networks to attach (typically `fleet-net`)
- `telegramUsers` / `telegramGroups` — who may DM the agent / which groups it listens to
- `groupListenMode` — `off` / `mention` / `all`
- `telegramSendOnly` — **must be `true`** on every non-CTO agent that shares a Telegram bot token with others (otherwise Telegram returns 409 Conflict — only one long-poller per token)
- `prefixMessages` — when multiple agents share a bot token, set `true` so outgoing group messages are prefixed with the agent's `shortName` (e.g. `[Developer] ...`)

## Troubleshooting

### Agents start returning "unauthorized" from Claude / Codex

OAuth tokens in `./fleet/.claude-credentials.json` and `./fleet/.codex-credentials.json` expire. When they do, every agent backed by that provider starts failing mid-task with an auth error. There is no in-container refresh path — you refresh on the host, then push the new file in.

1. Re-authenticate on your host with the vanilla CLI (`claude` or `codex`). This is the same CLI login flow you used during initial setup.
2. Copy the refreshed credentials into the fleet dir, overwriting the old file:
   ```bash
   # Claude — file location varies by platform:
   # Linux: ~/.claude/.credentials.json
   # macOS: stored in the login keychain as "Claude Code-credentials"
   #   (setup.sh handles the keychain extraction; for a manual refresh,
   #    the easiest path is to re-run ./setup.sh)
   cp ~/.claude/.credentials.json ./fleet/.claude-credentials.json
   chmod 600 ./fleet/.claude-credentials.json

   # Codex
   cp ~/.codex/auth.json ./fleet/.codex-credentials.json
   chmod 600 ./fleet/.codex-credentials.json
   ```
3. Reprovision every affected agent so each container picks up the new file. From the dashboard: click **Reprovision** on each agent. From the CLI:
   ```bash
   TOKEN=$(grep '^ORCHESTRATOR_AUTH_TOKEN=' ./fleet/.env | cut -d= -f2)
   for name in $(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:3600/api/agents | jq -r '.[].name'); do
     curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:3600/api/agents/$name/reprovision"
   done
   ```

Re-running `./setup.sh` also works — it re-copies the credentials and leaves the stack running.

### Gemini agents start returning "credentials not found"

Gemini uses OAuth tokens stored in `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`. The container mounts this file writable so the Gemini CLI's `google-auth-library` can refresh tokens in-place — unlike Claude/Codex, **you should not need to manually refresh gemini credentials** as long as the container stays running. Note: all gemini agents share the same `./fleet/.gemini-credentials.json` on the host; concurrent token refreshes rely on `google-auth-library`'s atomic rename write.

If the credentials file is missing or corrupted:
1. On the host, run: `gemini auth` (opens a browser for Google OAuth consent; writes `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`)
2. Re-run `./setup.sh` (choose option 3 or 5) to copy the fresh credentials into `./fleet/.gemini-credentials.json`
3. Reprovision the affected gemini agents from the dashboard

See `docs/providers/gemini.md` for full details.

### Telegram returns 409 Conflict at startup

Telegram allows only one long-poller per bot token. If two or more agents share a bot token and more than one tries to poll, Telegram rejects them all with 409. Fix: set `telegramSendOnly: true` on every non-CTO agent that shares a token — they'll still send messages through the bot but won't poll for incoming updates. Only the CTO agent (or whichever single agent owns DMs for that token) should poll. After editing `seed.json` or the DB, reprovision the affected agents.

### Temporal workflow types list looks empty right after a restart

`temporal_list_workflow_types` populates lazily on first call after `fleet-temporal-bridge` starts. Immediately after a restart it may return only the hardcoded built-ins and none of the seeded UWE workflow definitions. Wait a few seconds and call it again, or start any workflow once to warm the cache.
